# AdvancedRegression

# Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to predict house prices based on a variety of features such as location, size, and other property attributes. The dataset used for this project was extensive, with over 80 features that required careful preprocessing and feature engineering.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib for visualization

# Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps included:
Outlier Handling: Identified and treated outliers to ensure they do not adversely affect model performance.
Normalization: Applied scaling to numerical features to bring them to a similar range, enhancing model accuracy.
Categorical Encoding: Transformed categorical features into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.

The models were evaluated based on their ability to predict house prices accurately. XGBoost and LightGBM were the top-performing models, significantly reducing the RMSE compared to the baseline Linear Regression model.
